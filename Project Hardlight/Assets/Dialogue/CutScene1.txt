>>Taurin 
What is this place?
>>Merrha 
The spirits of the forests come here to... well I guess I don't really know why.
But it's always peaceful.
There used to be places like this all over Elene. 
But since Hardlight became so common...well they're disappearing. 
>>Nero
Since Hardlight?
What do you mean?
>>Merrha
Hardlight is, very powerful.
And that's great for humans, but not so great for, well, nature.
Hardlight creation requires ALOT of magical energy, which gets siphoned straight out of Elene. 
Which means that there's less to go around for the spirits. 
And when Hardlight is finished, it can power almost anything, including monsters. 
>>Taurin
Wait WHAT?
>>Nero
Are you saying these monsters are being somehow, energized by Hardlight? 
>>Merrha
Exactly.
Hardlight energy is everywhere! And Elene just, doesn't know how to handle it.
>>Nero
I didn't find anything about this in my research.
>>Merrha
Well, you wouldn't. People don't talk to the nature like they used to.
But I do! 
The monsters that are attacking, they're not evil they're just...
Confused. 
That's why I need your help! 
It's only going to get worse. 
The spirits, they all seem to think something is coming.
Something big. 
If we can't restore balance, it could be very, very bad. 
>>Taurin
Yikes.
>>Merrha
Please, both of you, help me. I could really use people like you. 
>>Taurin
Uhhh, yeah sure. I guess I don't have anything going on today.
>>Nero
Hmmm, I suppose this could be an incredibly fascinating oppurtunity. 
And I do have a very vested interested in well, living. 
I'm in.
>>Merrha
Amazing! 
The spirits, they can help us too. 
They want balance just as much as we do.
>>none
You have unlocked three souls!
Equip these to your party before a battle to enhance your party's stats!
>>Nero
Alright, where do we start.
>>Merrha
I have a friend who has a farm not too far from here.
She should be able to help.
>>Taurin
Let's go!
