>>>Kilenya
Help! Please Help!
>>>Taurin
Whoa! Who are you? What's wrong?
>>>Kilenya
I-I'm. Help- You need- Help- I need- Help-
>>>Krissos
Get a hold of yourself woman!
>>>Eoea
Hey! Be nice!
>>>Sigrid
It's okay. Tell us what's wrong.
>>>Kilenya
Monsters.
Wolves.
MONSTER WOLVES.
Attacking my farm.
Please you have to help.
>>>Taurin
How did you even find us?
>>>Krissos
Good Question
>>>Kilenya
They told me!
>>>Krissos
Who?
>>>Kilenya
The spirits! The souls!
Some of us still follow the old ways.
>>>Taurin
Huh???
>>>Kilenya
Please, I can explain more later! 
And I can help you!
The creatures you face are...angry.
But they're all connected!
When you defeat one, they'll leave behind pieces,
Pieces of their souls! 
Bring them to me and I can show you how to harness them!
But please, save my farm! It's just south of here!
>>>Sigrid
Okay. We can help.
>>>Taurin
Well, no time like the present.
>>>Merrha
Right. Let's go.
