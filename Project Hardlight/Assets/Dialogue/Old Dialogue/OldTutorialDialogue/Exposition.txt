The fate of this world hangs in a delicate balance.
The forces of nature. 
The strength of mankind. 
The magic that surrounds and energizes us all.
It's all so fragile.
Mankind, has upset this balance.
Recent technological development has given them the upperhand. 
The study of magic and technology have become intertwined, resulting in the creation of a new, highly adaptable form of energy.
Humans have used this energy to build vast cities, and powerful weapons, the use of which, have gone unchecked.
The forces of nature, are angry. 
Something is coming. 
Something that could mean the end. For everyone.
Something stronger than...
Hardlight.
