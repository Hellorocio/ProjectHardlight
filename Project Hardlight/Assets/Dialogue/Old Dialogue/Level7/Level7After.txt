>>Taurin 
Well, see any brave citizens to aid our cause?
>>Merrha
*Sigh*
No.
>>Nero
These people can't help us.
They're too busy cowering in their homes.
What now?
>>Merrha
I have an idea. 
If we can't find anyone to help, we'll have to take matters into our own hands. 
We need to shut down Hardlight. At the source. 
>>Nero
Shut down the refinery? 
That might work. 
It would at least buy us more time. 
>>Taurin
That's an awfully long walk...
>>Merrha
Well then we better get moving!
