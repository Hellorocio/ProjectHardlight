We did it!
>>Nero
Taurin are you okay?
You're crying!
>>Taurin
I'm fine I just-
*sniffle*
I just chopped so many onions. 
>>Merrha 
I don't think anyone here can help us. 
They'll be safer if they stay here. 
>>Taurin
Yeah, we wouldn't them to run into flaming slimes, or onions...
Or flaming onions. 
>>Nero
Let's rest for a bit before we plan our next move.
>>Merrha
Anyone hungry?
>>Taurin
Always!
As long as it's not onions...
