What is this place?
>>Nero
This is an ancient temple.
People come here to commune with the spirits.
I've read about it before but, I don't think many people ever visit.
>>Merrha
Yes, not since Hardlight was invented.
People don't need the spirits like they used to. 
We've got to go in.
I don't know what's waiting for us, but I think we're supposed to be here.
>>Taurin
I've got a bad feeling about this...
