>>Nero
Okay, I think we're in the clear for now. 
Merrha, you said you could help me.
>>Merrha
Yes. I know why the onion- I mean, monsters, are so angry.
It's Hardlight!
>>Taurin
Huh?
>>Merrha
Hardlight! Humans make TONS of it everyday! 
It uses up so much magical energy! 
And once it's made, its incredibly hard to get rid of.
It's making the monsters crazy!
>>Nero
I should've known...fascincating. 
>>Merrha
It's only going to get worse!
If we don't do something, the monsters will destroy everything!
>>Taurin
Yikes.
>>Nero
Yikes indeed. 
Well what can we do?
>>Merrha
Well first off, we need to get rid of all these monsters.
After that well, I guess we need to get everyone to stop using Hardlight.
Please, can both of you help me?
If we don't do something, everything will be destroyed.
>>Nero
I'm in. Sounds like it will be a fascincating oppurtunity!
And I have a vested interest in well, living.
Taurin?
>>Taurin
Uh, yeah sure. 
I guess I'm free today.
>>Merrha 
Amazing! We have help too! 
Not all the spirits are angry.
Some of them can lend us their strength.
>>None
You have unlocked three souls!
Equip them to your party before a battle to enhance their stats. 
>>Taurin
Awesome!
>>Nero
Well, where to now? 
>>Merrha
I've gotten word of some monsters nearby.
We should start there first.
>>Taurin
Sounds good!
