>>Nero
Okay, I think we're in the clear for now. 
>>Merrha
Yes. I know why the onion- I mean, monsters, are so angry.
It's Hardlight!
It uses up so much magical energy! 
It's making the monsters crazy!
If we don't do something, the monsters will destroy everything!
>>Taurin
Yikes.
>>Nero
Yikes indeed. 
Well what can we do?
>>Merrha
Well first off, we need to get rid of all these monsters.
Please, can both of you help me?
>>Nero
I'm in. Sounds like it will be a fascincating oppurtunity!
And I have a vested interest in well, living.
Taurin?
>>Taurin
Uh, yeah sure. 
I guess I'm free today.
>>Merrha 
Amazing!
>>Nero
Well, where to now? 
>>Merrha
I've gotten word of some monsters nearby.
We should start there first.
>>Taurin
Sounds good!
