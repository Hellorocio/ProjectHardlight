>>Taurin
WHOA!
What is that thing?
>>Merrha
A golem.
A spirit in a body of stone. 
They're extremely dangerous. 
>>Nero
I've read about these things.
I didn't think they still existed.
>>Merrha
I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of them. 
>>Taurin
So, what do we do?
>>Merrha
We'll have to take care of it. 
It's only a matter of time before someone else finds it. 
>>Taurin
Alright! 
Let me at him! 
>>Nero
Taurin wait! 
You need to be careful!
A few blows from this thing and you're a pancake!
>>Taurin
I love pancakes!
>>Merrha
She's right Taurin. You could get really hurt!
>>Taurin
I'll be fine! 
If things get too hairy I can just use my abilities to shield myself. 
I can handle this guy in no time. You guys should keep your distance.
>>Nero
Okay well, let's figure out a plan.
