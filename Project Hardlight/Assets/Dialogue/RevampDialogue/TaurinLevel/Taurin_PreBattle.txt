>>Taurin
WHOA!
What is that thing?!
>>Merrha
Ah, a Golem!
A spirit in a body of stone. 
They're extremely dangerous. 
>>Nero
I've read about these things.
I didn't think they still existed.
>>Merrha
They used to be gentle creatures and guardians of the forests.
>>Taurin
So, what do we do?
>>Merrha
We'll have to take care of it. 
It's only a matter of time before some poor soul runs into it.
>> Nero
Let's go at it then!
Er, it seems like there's a giant rock in the way.
It looks like there's only room for one of us to climb over it into the clear space.
Hmph. 
>>Taurin
Alright! 
Let me at him!
>>Nero
Taurin wait! 
You need to be careful!
A few blows from this thing and you're a pancake!
>>Taurin
I love pancakes!
>>Merrha
She's right Taurin. You could get really hurt!
>>Taurin
I'll be fine! 
I have a teleportation device that lets me avoid big blows. 
I can handle this guy in no time. You guys should keep your distance.
>>Nero
Hmph. Let's see how we can get over this rock first!
