>>Merrha
What are those green things? There's so many of them.
>>Nero
Aha! I know what those are!
>>Taurin
Giant peas with faces?
>>Merrha
Oh, now that you mention it, that's definitely what those are.
>>Nero
Yes, but not just ANY peas my dear Taurin!
Those are Peabuddies!
We used to use them to practice our magic in the farms around The University.
>>Merrha
That seems a little inhumane.
>>Nero
Nah, they're a pestilence to the farmers.
We're doing them a favor.
But anyway, what you should really be worried about are the blue things.
>>Merrha
Are those... giant blueberries with faces?
>>Nero
Youuuu got it!
They're called Blueflings.
They shoot projectiles too, but somehow they always follow you.
>>Taurin
Oh, so they're magical blueberries?
>>Nero
Something like that.
They're extremely dangerous because the attack makes you more vulnerable to other attacks.
We should definitely get rid of the Blueflings first.
I think the best course of action would be to send in the most capable person of defeating these menaces.
And that person... is me!
Not only am I a magical genius, I'm in top physical form!
>>Taurin
Ok, but I think I can withstand all those attacks better.
>>Nero
But against the Blueflings, time is of the essence.
The longer you take to kill them, the more they weaken you.
You don't have the power of "LIGHT PRISON!" to subjugate them quickly.
Not to mention those temptingly grouped Peabuddies would be a breeze with my LIGHT'S EXTOSIS!
Looks like there's several entrances into the farm.
Let's figure out how to approach this...
