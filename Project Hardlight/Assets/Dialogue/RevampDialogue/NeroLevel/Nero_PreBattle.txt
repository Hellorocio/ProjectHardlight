>>Merrha
Oh my, there's so many of them. 
These spirits typically move in groups but, I rarely see so many.
>>Taurin
What are we gonna do?!
How am I supposed to have fun in the sun with all these monsters?!
>>Nero
Well, we obviously have to get rid of them.
>>Taurin
But how?!
There's like a billion of them!
>>Merrha
This may be tough.
If we go in all at once we could get overwhelmed. 
>>Nero
I can take care of them!
I can use my abilities to create a spontaneous Hardlight reaction resulting in a cataclysmic magical discharge!
>>Taurin
Uhhh, what?
>>Nero
Oh uh, I can make a really big BOOM!
>>Taurin
NICE!
>>Merrha
That's a good idea. 
If you can create an explosion you can take out many of them at once.
>>Nero
Exactly!
Send me in!
>>Taurin
Let's get a closer look and figure out a game plan.
>>Merrha
Right.
