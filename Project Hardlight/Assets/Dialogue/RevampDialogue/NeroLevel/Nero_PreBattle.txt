>>Merrha
There it is! The farm.
Wait, what are those green things? There's so many of them.
>>Nero
Aha! I know what those are!
Because I went to The University.
>>Taurin
Excuse me?
You don't need to have gone to The University to see that those are giant peas with faces.
>>Merrha
Oh, now that you mention it, that's definitely what those are.
>>Nero
Yes, but not just ANY peas my dear Taurin!
Those are Peabuddies. At least that's what we called 'em.
We used to use them to practice our magic in the farms around The University.
>>Merrha
That seems a little inhumane.
>>Nero
Nah, they're a pestilence to the farmers.
We're doing them a favor.
But anyway, what you should really be worried about are the blue things.
>>Merrha
Are those... giant blueberries with faces?
>>Nero
Youuuu got it!
Wow Merrha, are you sure you didn't go to The University too?
>>Taurin
...why do you praise her for recognizing anthropomorphic produce but not me.
>>Nero
Haha, oh Taurin!
>>Taurin
I grow weary of your bullying.
>>Nero
Anyway! The blue things are called Blueflings.
They shoot projectiles too, but somehow you can't avoid them and they always follow you.
>>Taurin
Oh, so they're magical blueberries?
>>Nero
Something like that.
They're extremely dangerous because the attack makes you more vulnerable to other attacks.
Back in the University, when we received sightings of those we sent whole squads out to take care of them.
Or they would just send one of me, the top student!
We should definitely get rid of the Blueflings first.
I think the best course of action would be to send in the most capable person of defeating these menaces.
And that person... is me!
>>Taurin
I don't know, are you up to dodging all those attacks?
>>Nero
Not to worry!
Not only am I a magical genius, I'm in top physical form!
>>Taurin
Ok, but I think I can withstand all those attacks better.
>>Nero
Ah yes. Usually you're the one with the endless endurance.
But! Against the Blueflings, time is of the essence.
The longer you take to kill them, the more they weaken you.
You don't have the power of "LIGHT PRISON!" to subjugate them quickly.
Not to mention those temptingly circularly grouped Peabuddies would be a breeze...
>>Merrha
A breeze like my Dark Wind?
>>Nero
...No. A breeze for my cataclysmic magical discharge:
LIGHT'S EXTOSIS!
But enough chit-chat.
Looks like there's several entrances into the farm.
Let's figure out how to approach this...
