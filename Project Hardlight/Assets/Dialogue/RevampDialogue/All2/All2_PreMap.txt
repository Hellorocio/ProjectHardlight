Man, I'm tired. Can't we take a break?
>>Merrha
We can't stop until we've gotten rid of all the aggressive monsters.
Don't you want to save the world, Taurin?
>>Taurin
I mean...yeah. 
But can't that wait until tomorrow?
>>Nero
No!
>>Taurin
Fine.
>>Merrha
We're getting close to something, I can feel it. Stay cautious everyone.
