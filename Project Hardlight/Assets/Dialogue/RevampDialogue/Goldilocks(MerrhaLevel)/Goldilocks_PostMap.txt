>>Taurin
Alright, what's our next move.
>>Merrha
It's hard to say, we could run into monsters wherever we go. 
>>Nero
We should try to get to civilization. 
We could go to the city or we could head to the other side of the island.
Anywhere there's more people.
>>Merrha
That's a good idea. 
Maybe we can get some help.
Or at the very least, warn everyone about what's happening. 
>>Taurin
Sounds like a plan! 
As long as we don't run into anymore flaming rabbits.
>>Merrha
I can't promise that.
>>Taurin
I was afraid you'd say that.
