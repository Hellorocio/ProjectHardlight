>>Taurin
What are those things?
>>Nero
Awww! They're kind of... cute!
>>Merrha
Oh no... everyone be careful! And make sure they don't see you...
I've seen these things back home. They're called Infrerens.
They used to be docile creatures.
>>Taurin
...but now?
>>Merrha
Now...they're fearless, aggressive, and violent towards humans.
If they see you, they'll become filled with anger.
>>Nero
Well we have to clear them out right?
If they're that dangerous, we should get started!
STAFF READY!
>>Merrha
Shhhhh! Oh my god... Please... be quiet.
>>Nero
Huh? What's wrong?
>>Merrha
Trust me, Nero, I've seen what these things can do and it's terrifying.
If you'd seen what I've seen, you would want to stay away.
>>Taurin
I'm sure we can handle them.
>>Merrha
You see those barriers? We used to use similar Hardlight-enforced barriers to stop them.
Looks like one of the little ones was able to slip through. 
>>Taurin
We really have to destroy that thing?
>>Nero
Awww, that almost seems cruel.
>>Merrha
The little ones are dangerous too.
I can use my Dark Wind ability to reinfoce the barriers, and my attacks can reach the Infrerens before they get through!
I think it's best if you let me handle this one.
>>Taurin
I feel bad, if they really are as dangerous as you say.
But if you really think that's the best option...
>>Merrha
I do.
>>Taurin
Alright well, let's get a bit closer and decide what to do.
