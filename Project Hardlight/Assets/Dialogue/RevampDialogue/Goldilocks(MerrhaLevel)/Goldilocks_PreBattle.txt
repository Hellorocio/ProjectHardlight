>>Taurin
What are those things?
>>Nero
Awww! They're kind of... cute!
>>Merrha
Oh no... everyone be careful! And make sure they don't see you...
I've seen these things back home. They're called Infrerens.
You'd always be able to spot their glow in the forest at night.
From what my parents said, they used to be docile creatures that would run away if people got close to them.
Some people were able to make friends with them by offering kindling outside their doors. Kind of like if you put out a saucer of milk for a cat.
>>Taurin
...but now?
>>Merrha
Now... families of Infrerens attack households. They're fearless, aggressive, and violent towards humans.
If they see you, they'll become filled with anger and a boundless energy to destroy.
>>Nero
Well our client said to clear to clear them out right?
If they're that dangerous, we should get started!
STAFF READY!
>>Merrha
Shhhhh! Oh my god... Please... be quiet.
>>Nero
Huh? What's wrong?
>>Merrha
Trust me, Nero, I've seen what these things can do and it's terrifying.
If you'd seen what I've seen, you would want to stay away.
>>Taurin
I'm sure we can handle them.
>>Merrha
You see those barriers? We used to use similar Hardlight-enforced barriers to stop them.
Someone tried, but one of the little ones was able to slip through.
>>Taurin
We really have to destroy that thing?
>>Nero
Awww, that almost seems cruel.
>>Merrha
The little ones are dangerous too.
Actually, back home when anyone spotted a Infreren, they'd call me to get rid of it.
I've got the abilities to reinforce those barriers and destroy them before they get through.
I think it's best if you let me handle this one.
>>Nero
You just want all the fun for yourself!
>>Merrha
I wish that was the case. Trust me. You should send me in.
>>Taurin
I feel bad, if they really are as dangerous as you say.
But if you really think that's the best option...
>>Merrha
I do.
>>Taurin
Alright well, let's get a bit closer and decide what to do.
