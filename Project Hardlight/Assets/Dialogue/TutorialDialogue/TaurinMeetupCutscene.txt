*huff*
*huff*
I... don't know if I can take anymore of this.
It's so late already too. Do more monsters come out late at night?
Let's see where I'm supposed to go... ah it's still quite far.
>>none
...hello.
>>Taurin
!!!
Who's there?!
>>
It's me!
>>Taurin
Where?
>>Healer
Helloooooo!
Here!
>>Taurin
Who is that?!
>>
You mean "Who are they?!"
>>Taurin
...
>>Healer
I'm Generic Healer!
>>Mage
Hello.
I'm Generic Mage.
>>Healer
We have a sneaking suspicion that we're all going to the same place.
And also, I think you've noticed (we definitely know you've noticed) the monsters around here are tough.
>>Taurin
What do you mean you've definitely noticed?!
You saw me fighting that thing and didn't even help?
>>Mage
Hey, it was only one small monster.
If you can't even beat that puny thing, how would it be mutually beneficial for us to team up?
>>Taurin
...so it was a test that I nearly died.
Great.
Thanks.
>>Healer
But we're here now!
>>Taurin
Sure are. Name's Taurin.
>>Healer
Hi Taurin!!
>>Taurin
Alright enough of all this, you're headed to the New Grove right?
>>Mage
Correct.
>>Taurin
Then let's get a move on.
>>
(The party picks through the slowly-darkening forest until...)
>>Mage
...monsters ahead.
>>Taurin
I've still got my injuries, but let's do this.
>>Healer
I've got you covered!
Leeeeeeeet's go!
