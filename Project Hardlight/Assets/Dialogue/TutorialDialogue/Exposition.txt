The land of Elene is a riven island floating in space.
Lush forests and golden plains stretch across the land.
Lakes along the island's edges endlessly flow with crystalline water.
On Elene, the natural world teems with the spirits of nature.
Sometimes they are peaceful, and sometimes they are destructive.
Long ago, human beings and natural spirits learned to strike a balance.
While natural disasters and beastly spirits sometimes hurt humans, humans also harvested nature's bounty and respected the spirits.
And while nature suffered damage and modification from human activities, humans never took too much and restored as much as possible to the land.
But two decades ago, humans began to take the upper hand.
A new technological process could concentrate light into a highly adaptable energy form.
Among the greatest of achievements, humans created huge cities with strong city walls.
Artificial lamps, empowered weapons, medical devices, and more meant that humans could beat back the threats of nature.
Soon, the embodiments of nature that once danced around the land began to fade too.
Humans no longer worried so much about the threats of dangerous spirits or nature's own attacks.
This liquid light technology that enabled all this human progress was called...
Hardlight.
