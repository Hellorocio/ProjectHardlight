Okay, I think we're in the clear for now. 
Merrha, you said you could help me.
>>Merrha
Yes. I know why the onion- I mean, spirits, are so angry.
It's Hardlight!
>>Taurin
Huh?
>>Merrha
Hardlight! Humans make TONS of it everyday! 
It uses up so much magical energy! 
And once it's made, its incredibly hard to get rid of.
It's making the spirits crazy!
>>Nero
I should've known...fascincating. 
>>Merrha
It's only going to get worse!
If we don't do something, the spirits will destroy everything!
>>Taurin
Yikes.
>>Nero
Yikes indeed. 
Well what can we do?
>>Merrha
We need to get everyone to stop using Hardlight, at least until the spirits calm down.
Please, both of you, can you help me?
If we don't do something, things are going to get...ugly.
>>Taurin
Uh, yeah sure. I guess I'm free today.
>>Nero
Of course, It sounds like a fascincating oppurtunity. 
And I have a vested interest in well, living.
>>Merrha 
Amazing! We have help too! 
Not all the spirits are angry.
Some of them can lend us their strength.
>>None
You have unlocked three souls!
Equip them to your party before a battle to enhance their stats. 
>>Taurin
Well where to now?
>>Merrha
There's a farm not too far from here, we should go talk to them. 
Hopefully we don't run into much trouble.
>>Taurin
I think you spoke too soon, look up ahead.
>>Nero
To battle!
