Hello???
>>Merrha
Who's there?
>>Taurin
Hi, I'm Taurin.
Could you help us? we're kind of lost.
>>Nero
We are NOT lost Taurin.
Just...confused. 
Hi, I'm Nero. 
I'm here researching the recent spark in monster aggression. 
Taurin is my...assistant. 
>>Merrha
You're researching the spirits?
Hmm, I think I can help you.
And you can help me! 
I'm looking for a friend, she has a farm not too far from here. 
I think she knows why the spirits have been so...angry.
>>Nero
Well, that sounds like as good a lead as any. 
Taurin, let's go. 
>>Taurin
Right. 
>>none
Taurin and Merrha have joined the party!
